Note: The number of data batches reduced to 5 for demonstration purposes. Full amount of batches leads to long execution time. Results gained with reduced number of batches can differ from results gained with initial amount. All batches can be found in folder "data full".

For finding meta-features that are proxy to certain errors follow the steps: 

0. Make sure you have python version 3.8.5
1. Install dependencies 

      pip install -r requirements.txt
      
2. Collect all metrics with all errors applied
      
      python main.py
   
   Output file is in results/result.csv
   
   Log data is in suite.log
   
3. Find all unique error-metric combinations with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
      
      python ks_test.py   
   
   Output is in results/ks_output.csv. The output contains detected combinations of DQ issues and meta-features along with the minimal value of corruption's proportion they were detected by.
   
   Log data is in ks.log
   
4. Find all unique error-metric combinations with MIC
      
      python finding_mic.py
   
   Output is in results/unique_combinations_mic.csv. The output contains detected combinations of DQ issues and meta-features.
   
   Log data is in mic.log
